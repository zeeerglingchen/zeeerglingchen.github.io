                    Online shopping is really on an upward trajectory. But there is huge room for improvement:   
                    <a href = "https://www.cmo.com/features/articles/2015/4/30/adobe-summit-emea-retailers-need-to-capitalise-instore-on-the-influence-of-online-information.html#gs.dofjsg">"while 43% of sales are influenced by online, online sales account for only about 9% of retail."</a>

                    <br>
                    In my online shopping experience, I always find that choosing between a large number of products(on Amazon, for example) can be physically exhausting. 
                    And when I want to buy something really expensive and high-tech, I want to ask experts for advice.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also conducted some interviews with my friends and classmates and I realized that many UM students are facing the same problems and they are not able to find efficient solutions.

                            Radar is a shopping assistant that provides online shoppers with recommendations, helps them find the best deal, and 
                            manages all their orders and shopping history.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I decided to design a mobile application and a browser extension since <a href ="https://www.retaildive.com/news/45-of-online-shoppers-complete-purchases-via-mobile/544378/" >“45% of online shoppers complete purchases via mobile.” and 34% of them use computers.</a>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Mobile application and browser extension have the same features and can also share user accounts data when logging in with the same account.

                <p>
                    During the design of this application, I kept putting myself in the position of a user. I was trying to think in the way of the user who is confused about what she or he should buy when facing many options. For example, in the beginning, I was not sure about whether it should be a mobile application or a website or a plugin for a mobile application or a plugin for a browser. So I had four choices. Then I asked my friends and got their opinions. I found out most of the users would find they need a shopping assistant while they are browsing the shopping platform. No one would think that they need to ask a chatbot for help before they get confused by millions of products. So I decided to make it a plugin for a web browser, which makes it easily accessible. Users can just open the extension when they are browsing the shopping website instead of jumping around different pages or taking their cell phones out of their pockets. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As a consumer who suffers a lot when choosing items online, I want to save people’s time and effort in buying things online. Also, it can be a waste of money when people choose some expensive devices that they don’t need, which is very frustrating. During my talking with my target users, I found that many of them are interested in learning some basic knowledge of electronics, but they just don’t know how to start. So I hope this application can also be a good learning tool for people to start to know more and more of the electronic products.
