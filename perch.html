                <p>This summer, I worked as a UX/UI design intern at Perch in Ann Arbor.  Perch is an online talent solution for academic research groups, university departments and programs, and industrial R&D companies.
                    <br><br>
                    I was luck to see how a product is born from a simple idea and keeps evolving/iterating to a complex and unique platfrom.
                    <br><br>                   
                    I will continue to work with Perch through my last year at University of Michigan and I am excited to keep learning and growing along the process.</p>

                <span>User Interview</span>
                <p>I conducted 5 interviews with 5 PhDs from University of Michigan and wanted to understand their goals and frustrations and evaluate the current website. The interview consists of two parts: (1) General job searching experience and (2) their experience of using the website. I found out three samiliar pain points during interviews:</p>

                <span>Competitive Analysis</span>
                <p>With the insights from user interviews, I conducted a competitive analysis to help me learn from currently existing solutions in the market. I also realized how Perch is unique as a job searching platform for researchers. Athough big companies like Indeed and LinkedIn also provide some relevant jobs for researchers, here is still room for them to grow to meet needs of researchers and solve their pain points.
                <br><br>One insight I got from the analysis is that, unlike Perch users have to log in to view job postings, LinkedIn and Indeed allow users to explore most content on the website without logging in. Visitors will be asked to create an account when they want to do something on the platform.I believe this user flow is better than what we currently have.</p>

                        Although this understanding is a little bit biased, we consider this as a good opportunity for Ph.D. students and researchers to
                        show their social skills by implementing the video resume feature.
                        <br><br> 
                        The video resume normally would be one minute long. Users can use guideline we provide during the recording to organize their thoughts and be well-prepared.

                    <span>5. Multiple Ways to Validate Skills </span>
                    <P>The skill validation is a pain point for both job seekers and posters, especially for Ph.D. students who have many highly-specialized skills.
                    We provide 2 ways for users to validate their skills, which are validation by uploading a certificate and by validation from a faculty.

                    <P>I reduced the onboarding questions from 10 to 4 and all of them are skippable.
                    I want users to access the main content on the website as quick and easy as possible and collect their information when 
                    they have to provide such information to achieve their goals like uploading a resume to apply to a job.
