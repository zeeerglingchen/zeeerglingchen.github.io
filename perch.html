                <span>Background</span> 
                <p>
                    For Summer 2019, I worked as a UX/UI design intern at Perch under the ZLT program (<a href = 'http://zli.umich.edu/'>Zell Lurie Institute for Entrepreneurial Studies at the University of Michigan</a>).
                    </br>Perch is a startup trying to help students achieve their full career potential by connecting them to research opportunities. 
                    The core idea of Perch is that there is a niche for a job website specializing in research roles and connecting students with faculty or research labs.
                    </br>My main goals are <span class= 'inline-style'>redesigning the user flow, optimizing job search experience, and updating the UI library.</span>

                        By adopting a new information architecture on the search results page, the filter tool, the job list, and the job description section are all on the same page. It is much easier for users to check the detailed information of different jobs on the same page rather than jumping back and forth among different windows.

                <p>To get a general understanding of the original system, I created an interaction map of the Perch website.
                    It helps me get a basic idea of the user flow and the UI style of the original Perch website.</br>
                    Findings: 
                    </br>1. Users apply to jobs by sending emails to professors or recruiters.
                    </br>2. The UI seems very old and lacks consistency. 
                    </br>3. Users have to sign in or sign up to check job postings. 
                    </br>4. Users cannot keep tracking of their submitted applications.

                    Key takeaways for job search platforms are:
                    </br><b>Pros:</b> 
                            </br>1. Clean, professional, and consistent UI system.
                            </br>2. It is more efficient to put the list of job postings and job description on the same page.
                            </br>3. Users can apply to jobs without logging in.
                    </br><b>Cons:</b> 
                        </br>1. Most platforms support users to upload Resume but not CV.
                        </br>2. It is hard to distinguish industrial jobs and research jobs.

                    be impatient during the filling-in process.

                    will be suggested to create a Perch account to keep track of their submitted application status. 
                    I reduced the signup process to only 3 steps and I also added a preview section in the signup process to help users manage their account information.

                    </br> The goal of this round of iteration is to incorporate the process of creating an account into the job application process, so we can encourage users to register rather than to force them to do that. We ask users to upload their CVs first. And before they can submit applications, the website would scan their CVs and generate digital CVs for them, so we can get all the information that we need to create an account. Users can sign up with just one click after submitting applications.

                    <b>Usability Testing:</b> 
                    </br>We conducted 4 usability testings and most of the problems we found are with the job posting list section.
                    Key findings are:
                    </br>- Users wanted to know when was the job posted.
                    </br>- For research opportunities, oftentimes applicants need to connect to professors directly to find out if they are hiring people.
                    </br>- Users have to move their eyes both vertically and horizontally to view the job posting, it is hard for them to quickly skim through the job list section.

                    </br>- The filter tool might need more work on it.

                    </br> We kept doing more usability testings and also conducted a card sorting with users to help us know how to reorganize the hierarchy within the filter.
                    To help users match with the right job, we designed the matching algorithm feature which would show what is the percentage that their skills match the job description.

                    Key findinds are: 
                    </br>- The filter section should follow this hierarchy: results type, institution, location, and job type.
                    </br>- The institution and the location parts should allow users to search for keywords.

                <span> Balancing between business needs and users’ needs</span>
                <p>User-centered design. It’s true, but in real-world we need to balance with business needs. Such as from users’ needs, providing less functions can simplify workload and enhance efficiency. But more functions can increase user retention from business target. How to solve this conflict? This is where UX designer is needed to solve the problem and come up with new ideas! With keeping in mind both users’ needs and business target constraints.</p>
                <span>Closer cooperation with PM</span>
                <p>Especially when coming up with new ideas, closer cooperate with PM to make sure if the problem exists and is suitable for the target user group. This step is crucial to make sure everyone in the team are on the same page.</p>
