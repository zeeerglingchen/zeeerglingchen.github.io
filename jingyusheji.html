                    From March 2017 to August 2018, I worked at Whale Design as a product designer. Whale Design, which launched in 2017, takes companies' design requests and floats competitions for freelance designers, with the winner being allowed on work on the company's project and earning a bonus as well.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As the individual product/UX designer on this project, I was mainly responsible for the design of the second iteration of the website product. After the one-month user and market research, I decided to incorporate the gamification strategy into our product to optimize the design contest process and improve user experience.

                <span>Usability Problems in Current Design </span>
                <p>To quickly get familiar with the current website, I began my research by creating an interaction map of the current website and a contest flow diagram. I noticed there are two issues: </p>
                <div class = "bullet_p">
                    <p>	01. Averagely, one contest would have 150 submissions, but only 10% of them can earn prizes and others just get nothing. This contest mode can be a huge disappointment to those designers who work hard but get nothing</p>
                    <p> 02. Other than uploading designs and waiting for results, there is nothing else designers can do on the platform. There is potential to create new features for them. </p>
                </div>

            <div class = 'interview align-left'>
                <span>User Interview</span>
                <p> After previous research, 
                    I conducted 4 interviews with current users to understand their goals/pain points in their work as well as their experience on the website.
                    From interviews, I realized that the money is not always the motivation for designers to participate contests. Designers at different levels can have different goals.
                </p>
                <div class="inside_img">
                    <img src = "images/jingyu/userinterview-16.png">

            <div class = 'persona align-left'>
                <span>Personas</span>
                <p>Based on insitghs and data collected from the interviews, I created three peronas to help me understand different types of users and their goals. </p>
                <div class="inside_img">

            <div class = 'persona align-left'>
                <span>User Data Analysis</span>
                <p>An interesting detail that I noticed during interviews is that one designer said he has won 5 contests. But I know that 
                    we only have 21 contests on the platform at that time and 5 of them are still ongoing, which means he won 1/3 of all the contests.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This finding drew my attention, which made me want to explore the data about our designers, I had three questions in mind:
                </p>
                <div class = "bullet_p">
                    <p>	<span class="bold">01.</span> How many active designers do we have on the platform ? </p>
                    <p> <span class="bold">02.</span> What percent of designers have earned money from contests ?</p>
                    <p> <span class="bold">03.</span> Designers stop participating in contests after how many times of failures ?</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    I got the data from the development team and after analyzing the data, I have three surprising findings:
                </p>

                    After creating personas, I have a solid understanding of what needs do designers at different levels have. I want to
                    create a new mechanism to help different types of users achieve their goals and also participate in more contests.

                <p>
                    I decided to incorporate the gamification strategy into our product after brainstorming. I found game players and Whale Design
                    users have many things in common, especially they both care about improving their skills in the game or design and players or users with
                    skills at different levels would perform differently on the same task/contest. After two-week gamification research, I came up with four insights of how should I implement this strategy:
